##### Interface Function

> **Notice:**
> There are differences between different models in power supply interface, USB_VBUS interface, and USB_ID interface. Compatibility needs to be considered in software and hardware design.


* Power Output:
    * If you need to power the user load equipment, please use the VCC pin.

    > **NOTE** 
    > * The rated voltage of this interface is 12-17.6 V(decreases with the battery voltage). The current is limited to 3A. The maximum power output by the drone is 36-52.8W.
    > * Those VCC pins are on the same network, developers could connect the VCC pins according to actual requirements. But to ensure the drone output the current continuously and steadily, please connect 4 VCC pins at the same time.

  * Mavic 3 Enterprise Series is the USB Host device by default. The USB_ID pin (A6) must be pulled down.

  * The aircraft has no voltage output ability. It can only detect the presence or absence of external voltage. USB_ VBUS pin (A7) has no voltage output ability.

  * ON_DET pin (A8) is a detect pin of the Mavic 3 Enterprise Series external PSDK device. For 12-17.6 V voltage output, the opposite connected to the ON_DET pin (A8) **must be GND**, and do not connect any resistance in series.

* Data Communication:

    * If you want to use the USB 2.0 function, please use the USB_DP pin (B6) and USB_DM pin (B7).
    * To use the serial port on the drone to communicate with the user load equipment, please use the UART_RX pin (B8) and UART_TX pin (B5). UART_RX pin (B8) should connect with the TX side of the PSDK device and UART_TX pin (B5) should connect with the RX side of the PSDK device.

* Time Synchronization: If you need to use the synchronization signal output by the drone, please use the SYNC_PPS pin (A5).

#### Install the Payload
1. Install the spindle arm: Use four M2 × 12 screws to lock the payload, and the depth of the corresponding threaded hole on the payload is not less than 5.3 mm.
2. Install the auxiliary shaft arm: Use an M3 screw, auxiliary shaft sleeve, and auxiliary shaft rubber plug to lock the auxiliary shaft arm. Make sure the M3 screw passes through the center axis of the pitch axis.
3. The centroid of the payload
    * For a payload with a constant centroid, the payload must be on the vertical line of the pitch axis.
    * For a zoom camera with a variable center of the centroid, the payload must be on the vertical line of the pitch axis when the lens is at the maximum magnification.

##### Interface Function

> **Notice:**
> There are differences between different models in power supply interface, USB_VBUS interface, and USB_ID interface. Compatibility needs to be considered in software and hardware design.

* Power Output:
    * If you need to power the user load equipment, please use the VCC_24V pin.
       > **NOTE** 
       > * The rated voltage of this interface is 24V, and the total power output by the drone is 96w.
       > * Those VCC_24V pins are on the same network, developers could connect the VCC_24V pins according to actual requirements. But to ensure the drone output the current continuously and steadily, please connect 4 VCC_24V pins at the same time.

    * M300 device is in USB accessory mode, USB_ID pin (A6) **must be** floated.
    * If USB_VBUS pin (A7) is connected to the VBUS pin of the user's OSDK device, TVS devices should be connected for ESD protection. The voltage of this pin **should not exceed 5V**.
    * ON_DET pin (A8) is a detect pin of M300 external OSDK device. For 24V voltage output, the opposite connected to the ON_DET pin (A8) **must be GND**, and do not connect any resistance in series.

* Data Communication:
    * If you want to use the USB 2.0 function, please use the USB_DP pin (B6) and USB_DM pin (B7).
    * To use the serial port on the drone to communicate with the user payload device, please use the UART_RX pin (B8) and UART_TX pin (B5). UART_RX pin (B8) should connect with the TX side of the OSDK device and UART_TX pin (B5) should connect with the RX side of the OSDK device.
* Time Synchronization: If you need to use the synchronization signal output by the drone, please use the SYNC_PPS pin (A5).
