<div style="text-align: center"><p>Figure. E-Port Development Kit Connection</p></div></div>


1. Connect the E-Port of the drone to the coaxial female connector, and **pay attention to the corresponding pins**.
2. Connect the coaxial male connector to the E-Port connection. The side A faces the E-Port adapter board bottom plate (foam measurement) and side B faces the front of the E-Port (chip device side).

> **Note:** The E-Port coaxial cable is not foolproof, and A/B can be reversed. However, due to differences in the Type-C wiring sequence of the drone, if the coaxial cable is reversed, the A/B on the other end of the coaxial cable also needs to be flipped and connected accordingly. **If there is no corresponding flip on the other end of the coaxial cable, the E-Port developer kit will not be able to provide normal power and communication.**

3. Switch the USB ID switch to Host.
4. If there is a demand for power supply through the E-Port developer kit, please pay attention to the voltage value provided by each port to prevent damage to the payload device.
5. Connect the serial port of the payload device.
6. Connect the USB 2.0 interface to the payload device USB device/USB OTG/network port.

> **Note:** In the scenario of connecting to the payload device network port, the USB2.0 interface can be connected to the network cable through a USB to network card cable.

### Using OSDK Extension Module

The OSDK extension module is about to stop production, and it is recommended to use the E-Port development kit. If you want to learn about OSDK extension module, you can go to [OSDK Extension Module](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/drone-port.html) of Standard Hardware Port.

## Hardware Reference Design

[Hardware Reference Design](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Payload-SDK/blob/master/doc/reference_designs/Type-C%20Schematic%20Reference.pdf)

The above hardware connection is mainly based on DJI's development accessories to build a development environment, facilitating developers to quickly build a hardware environment and start PSDK software development. Usually, when the device is developed, it can be directly integrated into the device hardware environment based on the hardware pins on the drone, without the need for DJI expansion accessories, such as OSDK expansion adapter boards, E-PORT kits, etc.

Convenient for developers to integrate hardware connections based on OSDK/PSDK type C ports. DJI provides reference schematics for M300 OSDK type C ports, M350 E-PORT type C ports, and M30/M3 industry version PSDK type C ports. Developers can refer to and combine their own hardware device designs.
